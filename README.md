#Hello!
My First Web App repository to test Git tutorial and other knowledge gained on Git usage. 
This is me getting hands on the usage. Largely following Git tutorial on https://www.w#school.com/

This repository is built following step by step in the tutorial. You just have to be resilient to keep pushing, it is a bespoke journey. Trust you will be brave enough to take yours.
